## payment Server

This project provides a basic framework for building a payment server using Node.js. 
It handles payment process, credit top up, and other payment related features for multiple apps/SaaS with only one payment gateway account.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm installed ([https://nodejs.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://nodejs.org/))

**Installation:**

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gammarinaldi/payment-server.git
    npm install
    ```
    

**Running the Server:**

1.  Start the server:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This will typically start the server on port `4000` by default. You can customize the port by modifying the server code.
